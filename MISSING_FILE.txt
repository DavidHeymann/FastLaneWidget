IMPORTANT: The gradle-wrapper.jar file is missing due to network restrictions.

To fix this, you have TWO options:

OPTION 1 - Let GitHub Actions download it (EASIEST):
Just upload the project as-is. The first build might fail, but then:
1. Go to your repo on GitHub
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Download gradle-wrapper.jar from: 
   https://github.com/gradle/gradle/raw/master/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
4. Upload it to: gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
5. Run the workflow again - it will work!

OPTION 2 - Generate it locally (if you have Gradle):
Run: gradle wrapper
This will create gradle-wrapper.jar automatically.

Don't worry - this is just one small file and easy to add!
